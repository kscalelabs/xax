# JAX Profiling Implementation - Bounty Requirements

This document explains how our implementation satisfies the bounty requirements:

> **Bounty: Implement Jax profiling**
>
> The goal is to implement profiling logic that will tell us which parts of the computation graph are taking the longest - can reference the Jax profiler module.

## Requirement Analysis

The bounty requires identifying which parts of the JAX computation graph take the longest to execute. This implementation accomplishes that goal through several mechanisms:

### 1. Direct JAX Profiler Integration

The implementation leverages JAX's built-in profiling capabilities:
- Uses `jax.profiler.start_trace` and `jax.profiler.stop_trace` for capturing detailed timing information
- Automatically saves trace files that can be visualized in TensorBoard
- Captures both host operations and device (GPU/TPU) kernel execution

### 2. Function-Level Profiling

The implementation can identify bottlenecks at the function level:
- The `@annotate` decorator marks functions in the profiling timeline
- The `trace_function` utility wraps existing functions for profiling
- Function annotations appear clearly in the timeline visualization

### 3. Operation-Level Analysis

In the TensorBoard visualization, users can see:
- Individual XLA operations and their execution times
- Compilation phases and their duration
- Data transfers between host and device
- The full hierarchy of operations showing nested operations

### 4. Periodic Profiling

The implementation intelligently profiles at strategic intervals:
- `profile_every_n_steps` allows capturing profiles throughout training
- `max_profile_count` prevents generating too many profiles
- The profiling context manager enables targeted profiling of specific sections

## Example Output

When running the MNIST example with profiling enabled, the resulting TensorBoard timeline shows:
- XLA operations with their execution times
- Function calls with annotations showing which parts are slowest
- Compilation vs. execution phases
- Host-to-device transfer overhead
