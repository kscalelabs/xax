# JAX Profiling Implementation for XAX Framework

## Overview
This PR implements JAX profiling capabilities for the XAX framework, enabling users to efficiently identify performance bottlenecks in JAX computation graphs. The implementation leverages JAX's built-in profiling tools and provides a user-friendly interface through a mixin architecture.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
1. **ProfilerMixin**: 
   - Implements a configurable profiling system based on JAX's `start_trace` and `stop_trace` APIs
   - Provides context managers and utility functions for profiling different parts of code
   - Configurable via standard XAX configuration parameters

2. **Profiling Utilities**:
   - `annotate` decorator for highlighting specific functions in profiling traces
   - `trace_function` for non-invasive wrapping of existing functions
   - `open_latest_profile` for programmatic TensorBoard visualization

3. **Integration with Training Loop**:
   - Added profiling hooks in the train and validation steps
   - Conditional profiling based on step count to minimize overhead
   - Automatic trace saving to experiment directories

### Computation Graph Analysis
The implementation captures:
- XLA operation execution times
- Function call hierarchies with timing information
- Host-to-device transfer overhead
- Compilation and execution phases

### Key Technical Challenges Solved
- Non-intrusive profiling that doesn't disrupt JAX's compilation caching
- Balancing profiling frequency with performance impact
- Integrating profiling into the existing training loop architecture
- Making profiling results easy to interpret and visualize

## Documentation and Examples
- Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/profiling.md`
- Included a complete MNIST example with profiling in `examples/profiling/`
- Added inline documentation for all classes and methods

## Testing
- Verified profiling outputs show accurate timing information
- Tested with various model architectures to ensure robustness
- Confirmed TensorBoard integration works properly

## Future Work
- Add memory profiling capabilities
- Support for distributed training profiling
- Additional visualization options

This implementation satisfies the bounty requirements by leveraging the JAX profiler module to identify which parts of the computation graph are taking the longest to execute.
